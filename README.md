##About
Personal Discord bot I built using node.js while being hosted on a `heroku-16` stack, the bot is intended to be for fun commands and (server-specific) management. I made this Open Source because I wanted to actually do an 'actual' project using CI, automatic deployment and most importantly for people to see, learn and maybe even improve their own bots.

##Add the bot to your server
[Invite link.](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=328968948894662666&scope=bot)
I am hosting the bot on a (at the time of writing) free dyno, if the bot garners more popularity and my free dyno will no longer suffice I will upgrade my dyno.
###Note
Users can use this bot to create imagery that may be considered offensive. In the future I may add a toggle option for server owners to disable some commands.
